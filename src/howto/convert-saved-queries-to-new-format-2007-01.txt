Converting Saved Queries to New Format

Last Updated: 2007/02/27 Reid

Overview:

We changed the saved query system at the beginning of the year.  The old system dealt
with each field individually.  The new system deals with collections of filter
parameters and display fields.  This is a significant database change that takes a while
to convert properly.
