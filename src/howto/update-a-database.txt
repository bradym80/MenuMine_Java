How to Update a Database

Last updated: 2007/02/27 (reid)

1. Joe will give you an access database with updated information.

2. Convert the access database to MySQL using an automatic tool such as PremiumSoft's Navicat

3. Create any new FieldEnums you might need for additional data FSRIN has added to their
product.

4. Update src/non-java/spring.properties properties to reflect the new data location

5. Execute the test UpdateDatabaseStructureCommandTest (src/java-util/produtil)

6. Execute the SQL statements in src/sql/data-ddl-2006-02-16 -- note that some of 
these will already have been taken care of by the previous step and MySQL will 
return an error.  No big deal.

7. Execute the test DataEmptyToNullConverterCommandTest (src/java-util/produtil).  This converts
0 dollar values and empty strings to NULLS for easier display

8. Execute the test KeywordBuilderCommandTest (src/java-util/produtil).  This takes a while as it
goes through every record to find all unique works in any field.  It will output
progress statements to the console.

The database is now ready to use.
